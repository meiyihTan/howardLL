## Dataset
Please follow the steps from the original [code](https://github.com/cchen156/Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark).

Please download RGB images from  [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NDlZtsyvfSHuxqEn9l-mCr9BHKztpAy4?usp=sharing).

## Testing
Please download the pretrained models [here(this is SID's weight)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DvDDEYhBNtlrsCvIRO5GI5ghkUGoRjDI?usp=sharing), and put them in the folds "checkpoint/Sony/" and "checkpoint/Fuji/" respectively.#not usable in this work

The weight of this model trained at 500 epoch for IC15 dataset is in weight/model.pth or [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fo8LSy4sOKQvkFLLFMolnTakgev6h8ky?usp=sharing)


1. To test Sony data, run
```
python test_Sony.py
```
By default, the result will be saved in "result_Sony/final" folder.

2. To test Fuji data, run
```
python test_Fuji.py
```
By default, the result will be saved in "result_Fuji/final" folder.

## Training
1. To train the Sony model, run
```
python train_Sony.py
```
The result and model will be saved in "result_Sony" folder by default.

2. To train the Fuji model, run
```
python train_Fuji.py
```
The result and model will be saved in "result_Fuji" folder by default.
